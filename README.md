# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created to provide a structured and organized way to review the topics covered in the prework. My motivation was to consolidate notes and key information into a single, easily accessible location. This project serves as a study aid for beginners learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It helps solve the problem of  unorganized study materials, ensuring that I have a go-to resource for quick review. Through this project, I learned how to structure a webpage, utilize various web development technologies, and implement basic JavaScript functionalities.
